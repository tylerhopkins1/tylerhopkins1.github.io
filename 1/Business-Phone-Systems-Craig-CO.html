<p>Our VoIP hosted telephone system can increase worker efficiency, enhance customer care levels and lower IT costs. Due to advances in IT cloud-based phone systems are now able to use almost the very same sophisticated functions to start-ups and small businesses. The basic features of a PBX system are auto-attendance, conferencing, voicemail and integration.

This transfer to the cloud has actually decreased expenses for small business, and yet at the very same time increased the number of functions you get access to.</p>
