While Digital Phone Systems are useful and practical; they're not mobile. However, if your business needs to comply with security policies that require information to be kept on-site, then a hosted solution is most likely not the very best option. The only distinction between Centrex and today's hosted phone systems (besides the lower expense these days's hosted systems) is that the Centrex systems ran over the standard phone networks (the conventional phone lines) rather of the Internet (as is the case with a hosted VoIP system today).</p>
